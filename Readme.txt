Game features:

The game has 7 levels. Most of them has a time limit.
In some levels you have to collect a certain
amount of items or save people. Only then the exit will
show up. Blue monsters can eat some items. When a monster
eats an item, the monster becomes darker so you can tell
it has the item. To recover the item you have to kill the
monster.
In several level you only need to find the exit.
The mini map will help you to search for the exit.
Items are marked green and the exit is red.
