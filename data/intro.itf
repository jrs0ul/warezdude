Greetings, Jack ! 
I see you at the spot already.
This is the last place where you can still
find some of the old media 
from the pre war era.
I know how you love those
old video games of yours.
So there are total of 8 levels where 
you can grab some nice loot !
But be careful, there are plenty of
mutants and other treasure seekers!
